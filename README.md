# Rating-Prediction

I made rating prediction for some user and movies.

First of all I have a dataset which contains 1.1M data.
This dataset include 35184 user and 7331 movie.

I made some prediction for user's rank for some movies.
In this prodection I used User Based Collaborative Filtering and Item Based Collaborative Filtering.

Then, I calculate Movie's average and User's average.
Finally I wrote a algorithm which based on UBCF,IBCF,Movie's average and User's average.

RMSE of my predictions is 0.94
I take my data from train.csv, prediction info from test.txt and I wrote my prediction in prediction.txt
That was my CMP2003 Course Project and I got A.
